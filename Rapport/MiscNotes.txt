Visit to ABB avd. Bryne. 
Introduced to the working environment at ABB, got a tour of the different divisions. Got to see the equipment and components
 which the tests are performed on. 

Here we got a broader idea of what the program needs to be, and why it is needed.
We discussed the idea of getting the html and xml objects directly from the python script, rather than going from object, to html, then to object again.
However as the tests are run in parallel, and also can finish at very different times, we had to scrap that. 
This resulted in that we agreed to make a very basic script that gathers all html files into one. Links makes it easy to navigate from 
overview to a test that has failed, and back again. 

We are suggested to let Morten know if we want any changes made in the info that is retrieved in the html files.
Morten suggested that timestamps could be relevant, and might be used to link from html to the log file.
